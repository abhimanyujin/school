<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 102, 255)" >PPE Kit has many sub parts like Mask , Gown , gloves , googles etc <br>
   Mask -  Nonwoven polypropylene and textile material is fed from bobbins into machinery that cuts and ultrasonically welds it together.
  <br> Gowns - gowns are generally made with spunbond or meltblown nonwovens produced via thermal, chemical, or mechanical bonding. The raw material for this cloth is synthetic, typically polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene, or something similar.
<br>Medical Gloves - can be made of several different types of rubber, from latex to natural rubber to nitrile.
<br> Googles - usually start with an injection molded lens made from high purity polycarbonate, one of the more impact- and scratch-resistant plastics

<h2 style="color:rgb(0, 102, 255)" >  Surgical Masks are made with non-woven fabric, which has better bacteria filtration and air permeability while remaining less slippery than woven cloth. The material most commonly used to make them is polypropylene, either 20 or 25 grams per square meter (gsm) in density. Masks can also be made of polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyethylene, or polyester.</p>

    Visors can be made up of plastics such as polycarbonate, propionate, acetate, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (also known as PETG).  </p>

<h1>> To use PPE kits made with Disposable plastic only 
    <br>> It is important to ensure the item is properly dismantled or destroyed, however, so that someone doesn’t try to continue to use the equipment. Using outdated or damaged personal protection equipment can cause people serious harm and put them at major risk for injury.<br>
</h1><h1>> For standard contaminants like, for example, lead, the PPE must be cleaned first to remove this heavy metal. Once properly cleaned, it will be contained and then disposed of properly to avoid the risk of groundwater contamination.</h1>
